cryptocatalogue
===============================================================================

This is a catalogue of cryptographic properties, security games, schemes and 
protocols.  It can be used in two ways:

 - As an overview of the available schemes, properties etc. which can be read 
   from beginning to end or per topic.  This is the PDF.
 - A (command-line) tool (`crycat`) to search for the schemes that matches 
   given criteria.

It is written as a literate program (using NOWEB), which makes the contents and 
tool (source code) seamlessly integrated into each other.
